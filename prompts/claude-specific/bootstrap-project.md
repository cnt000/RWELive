We are building a Live Companion Web App using:

- RedwoodSDK
- Cloudflare Workers
- Durable Objects
- D1
- KV
- TypeScript

The app must support:
- YouTube live embed
- Realtime chat
- Google + Slack login
- Admin role
- Plugin system (lottery + Q/A)
- YouTube live selection in admin panel

First task:
1. Propose a full folder structure.
2. Define database schema (D1).
3. Define Durable Object classes needed.
4. Define main environment bindings.
5. Then generate the initial project skeleton.

Do not implement everything yet.
Focus only on architecture and scaffolding.
